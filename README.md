# Library [![codebeat badge](https://codebeat.co/badges/76d3643c-4775-438a-acdf-76f901dfb645)](https://codebeat.co/projects/github-com-alana91-library-master)

Small library system project for college.

**Known issues (yup, just so you know that I know in an attempt to make it less ugly):**
- Method to set debt when a loanDTO is updated is untested. Completely. I don't meant unit tests. :sweat:
- Nonexistent validations
- Wiring doesn't work when used in utils and actually breaks wiring elsewhere (?), so using singletons instead
